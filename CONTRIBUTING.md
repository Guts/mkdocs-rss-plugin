# Contributing Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for considering to contribute to this project! :tada::+1:

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Git hooks

We use git hooks through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce and automatically check some "rules". Please install it before to push any commit.

See the relevant configuration file: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Code Style

Make sure your code *roughly* follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and keeps things consistent with the rest of the code:

- docstrings: [sphinx-style](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html#the-sphinx-docstring-format) is used to write technical documentation.
- formatting: [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used to automatically format the code without debate.
- static analisis: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used to catch some dizziness and keep the source code healthy.
